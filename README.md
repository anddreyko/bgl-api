BGL is an API designed for **4Records** — a project dedicated to tracking and managing tabletop gaming sessions. It
provides structured data handling for recording game sessions, player statistics, and other relevant details.

### Key Features:

- **Session Tracking** – Log gameplay sessions with timestamps, participants, and results.
- **Game & Player Management** – Store game details and player profiles.
- **Data Integration** – Facilitates seamless data exchange between 4Records and external systems (BGG-like systems).
